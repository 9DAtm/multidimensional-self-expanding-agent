9DA Demo Notice

This repository includes a zero-friction, browser-only
visualization of governed agent behavior.

To view the interactive demo:
- open demo_viewer.html in any modern web browser
- click “Run Governed Replay”

This replay is deterministic and illustrative.

The original Python-based orchestration pipeline
(System 2 → signal extraction → System 1 evaluation)
is preserved conceptually but disabled here to ensure
immediate, failure-free viewing on platforms such as
GitHub Pages.

No Python runtime is required for the demo layer.
